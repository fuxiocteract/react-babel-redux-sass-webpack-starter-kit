#This is a webpack template for React, babel, redux and sass workflow

Execute npm run dev in the terminal to fire up a dev server @ localhost:8080.

You can access the work in a browser with address localhost:8080. Any change
to js and sass files will trigger an automatic recompile and will update to the
browser.

The workflow now contains:
1. react compile
2. babel, es6/es7 compile
3. sass compile
4. font-awesome is already included
5. a basic redux flow

Future releases:
1. include a production build script
2. integration with redux router
